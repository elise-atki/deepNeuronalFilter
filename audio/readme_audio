Run ./eeg_filter 5 for audio data stored in participant 5.

See 'dnf so far' for screenshots of current code.

Issues :

DNF weak comonality at around 9000 samples learning starts cancelling out bass sig too.

Gains & filtering messy -still playing around with these.

Began integrating the DNF into my previous lms code - still debugging.
